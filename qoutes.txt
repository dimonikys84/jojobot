You're a Stand user, after all. If I were to start filming what's going on right now... The people of this town would only see themselves as snails, rolling in the filth that they created, thinking that that is the truth. This phenomenon will continue as long as Weather is alive... and besides, Weather, you would have eventually noticed that I had taken my own ability to see. That's why I took the time to explain this ability to you.","Listen, Jolyne. People have called me a murderer. The papers called me that, and I can't say I disagree with them. When people asked me if I would sacrifice myself for the sake of my family, I answered 'no'. I'd probably answer that way, even now. My heart was never moved by them. But I know that I'd be willing to risk my life for something that was able to revive me. I used to be dead. Weather was that way, too. Weather came back to life when he left that prison. I can tell. So don't think too deeply about what happened to him. These past few days, Weather was happy. Weather was already saved.","Our Lord Jesus Christ was fated to be put on the cross.

Babbling, in this situation...","............]","In the name of God, I will destroy you! Your actions, Emporio... You're just... Making it so your screams become the trumpets of Hell!

The flowers next to it rapidly wilt, the dried and decaying petals falling onto Emporio's mortified face.]","And! I've accelerated time again! In front of my honorable ambitions...","[Made In Heaven begins to attack Emporio with a flurry of punches.]","Realize your insignificance as you crumble away!","[In the remade universe, after a woman and man resembling Jolyne and Anasui come across a stranded Emporio, who remains from the original universe.]","What's your name? Come on, get in! I'm not going to take your money.

Emporio tears up, and begins to cry.]","I'm Emporio...","Hm?","Emporio. My name... my name is Emporio.","Mountain What's this fury I'm feeling all of a sudden? So such a thing was present during the race... Don't worry, feel at ease... I can't possibly win the race now. In this race, I have many friends who are also participating. But up until now, I've never seen anything like this before... such a killing method! However, I have heard a legend about similar deaths... There's an old Indian legend that tells about a spot where a shooting star fell somewhere in the Arizona desert. There lies tainted soil. It is said that anything that touches the spot, will suddenly be able to pull out a mysterious power from its own. At the same time, though, evil spirits will call out a curse upon them. None of the natives of the land will dare step foot there. One day, a white man looking for emerald ore stepped into the spot and started to walk home. It is said that afterwards, he began to kill others in a similar fashion. And afterwards, as if possibly realizing his own sinfulness, he shot himself.","Have you ever seen an opera show? An opera...","Opera? Those music plays? Where they start singing out situations when they could just say their lines? ...Nope, never seen one. Why do you ask?","Just a simple question.","[Gyro holds up his pair of binoculars.]","They call these opera glasses because you use them for watching an opera. But the people singing on stage have huge bodies that weigh like or 150 kilograms or more.","Yeah... that's why they can sing like that I guess.","But why look at them with opera glasses? You don't need to, cause they're already so big.","[Johnny grins, and soon Gyro follows suit. Gyro holds up the binoculars, looking out over the desert through them.]","Maybe you're supposed to zoom into the buttons on their fancy clothes, and watch them as they're about to fly off...?","Now that you mention it... but dude! Since they all have the same body type, maybe you can't tell the difference unless you zoom in?!","Nyohohahohahaha!! Not bad, Johnny!!","There's a small villiage up ahead... let's stay there. Camping out is a bad idea. There are beasts out in this area. The other day after sundown, I got surrounded by beasts. A few cougars and a few rattlesnakes. The cougars and snakes were on two sides of the road, blocking my way out. I was thinking of how to escape... but then, for some reason, I was able to pass through on one side of the road. I was able to get by one of the two groups easily. Which side do you think it was? The cougars? Or the snakes?","Gyro and ........","The answer is the rattle snakes! Because they were... assssssssssleep... and sssssssssnoring on the road!","Huh?","...........................","Hey, come on, it's a joke! Only a joke! What did you think?

Hurry and get outside, Johnny!","[Gyro slams the door shut, but Diego's claws fit through the space between the door and the wall. Gyro and Johnny slam it back shut.]","What is this!? This Stand ability!! What kind of ability is it?","It's a dinosaur, Johnny! It looks like Dio's body has fused with a dinosaur's ability!","Dino-sore? What's a dinosore?","You don't know?","[After absorbing one of the Corpse's eyes, a half-transformed Diego looks back at Johnny and Gyro. A mechanical-looking figure that slightly resembles one of Gyro's steel balls can be seen in the distance for a few panels.]","What's going on!? What does that mean!? Dio's dinosaur transformation hasn't gone away! Dio was under the control of Ferdinand!! We have to chase him or he'll take away that eye!","Stop, Johnny... It's over now, calm down. We can't chase him here. Dio got us at the very end... or maybe we should say he got the eye and its power brought back the dinosaur transformation that had disappeared as his talent. Half to my steel ball... half to Dio's Stand ability is what it seems.","The ability of the dinosaur... Dio Brando may not have been a terrorist... but if he has one of the eyes, he'll want the other! At this point he's found out about the Corpse...... I can't believe he took half... He doesn't just desire victory! He longs for authority and eliteness!","[After a suspenseful battle of Johnny, Gyro, and Diego racing neck to neck, Johnny crosses the goal line first, followed by Diego and then Gyro.]","At this point, theh stage has already begun! Johnny Joestar is the one who conquered the deadheat battle just now, but an hour ago, Hot Pants had already passed through the finish line to take 1st place!","[The stage's scoreboard is shown, with Hot Pants' name at the time.
